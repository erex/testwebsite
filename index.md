###  Eric makes a website on github

I am using github facility for the first time.

I will make a list with
* element 1
* element 2
  * subelement 2.1
* element 3

I will link to [distance sampling] for demonstration purposes.

More challengingly, I will link to another [page on this site].

Even more bravely, I would link to an ![image][image] (if I had any).



[distance sampling]: http://distancesampling.org
[page on this site]: page2.md
![image]: image.png
