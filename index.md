###  Eric makes a website on github

I am using github facility for the first time.

I will make a list with
* element 1
* element 2
  * subelement 2.1
* element 3

I will link to [distance sampling] for demonstration purposes.

More challengingly, I will link to another [page on this site].

#### Regular html used to insert image with adjusted size
<img src=3607_a2.png height=400 width=300>

I am going to ramble a bit because I simply need text filler to live around the edges of the image I have just tried to insert that follows this banal text.  OK Dave, you can read this now if you have finished getting ready for the St. Andrews gala dinner.

Even more bravely, I would link to an <img src=2-17-20141.jpg height=500 width=400 align=right> (if I had any).

My last trick is a ![video clip][testvideo]
