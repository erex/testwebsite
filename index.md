###  Eric makes a website on github

I am using github facility for the first time.

I will make a list with
* element 1
* element 2
  * subelement 2.1
* element 3

I will link to [distance sampling] for demonstration purposes.

More challengingly, I will link to another [page on this site].

#### Regular html used to insert image with adjusted size
<img src=3607_a2.png height=400 width=300>


Even more bravely, I would link to an ![image][image] (if I had any).

My last trick is a ![video clip][testvideo]


[distance sampling]: http://distancesampling.org
[page on this site]: page2.md
[image]: 2-17-20141.jpg
[testvideo]: CT1-Q1c.mp4
